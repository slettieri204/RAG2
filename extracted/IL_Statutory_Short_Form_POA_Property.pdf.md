# STATE OF ILLINOIS NOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL SIGNING THE


# ILLINOIS STATUTORY SHORT FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR PROPERTY

755 ILCS 45/3-3

PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY. The form that you will be signing is a legal document. It is
governed by the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. If there is anything about this form that you do not
understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.

The purpose of this Power of Attorney is to give your designated "agent" broad powers to handle your financial
affairs, which may include the power to pledge, sell, or dispose of any of your real or personal property, even
without your consent or any advance notice to you.

When using the Statutory Short Form, you may name successor agents, but you may not name co-agents. This
form does not impose a duty upon your agent to handle your financial affairs, so it is important that you select an
agent who will agree to do this for you. It is also important to select an agent whom you trust, since you are giving
that agent control over your financial assets and property.

If you name a successor agent, the successor agent may act for you only after the first agent is no longer able to
act or is no longer willing to act for you. Any agent, whether named in the statutory short form or in another power
of attorney form, may be subject to the requirements of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act regarding the duties of
agents.

The agent is required to use the property for your benefit and is prohibited from making gifts of your property
unless you have specifically granted that power in paragraph 3 of the form. Otherwise, your agent may use your
property for the benefit of your agent or others only if such use has previously been established by you or by a
court order. The agent is required to keep records of receipts, disbursements, and significant actions taken as your
agent.

This Power of Attorney does not authorize your agent to appear in court for you as an attorney-at-law or otherwise
engage in the practice of law. This Power of Attorney will not give your agent any authority over your health care
decisions.

This Power of Attorney may be amended or revoked by you at any time and in any manner. Absent amendment or
revocation, the authority granted in this Power of Attorney will become effective at the time this Power is signed
and will remain in effect until your death. A revocation of this Power of Attorney is not effective as to your agent or
any third party until the agent or third party receives actual notice of the revocation.

# STATE OF ILLINOIS NOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL SIGNING THE

ILLINOIS STATUTORY SHORT FORM
POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE
755 ILCS 45/4-10

No one can predict when a serious illness or accident might occur. When it does, you may need someone else to
speak or make health care decisions for you. If you plan now, you can increase the chances that the medical
treatment you get will be the treatment you want.

In Illinois, you can choose someone to be your "health care agent." Your agent is the person you trust to make
health care decisions for you if you are unable or do not want to make them yourself. These decisions should be
based on your personal values and wishes.

It is important to put your choice of agent in writing. The written form is often called an "advance directive." You
may use this form or another form, as long as it meets the legal requirements of Illinois. There are many written
and online resources to guide you and your loved ones in having a conversation about these issues.

The form that you will be signing is a legal document. It is governed by the Illinois Power of Attorney Act
(755 ILCS 45/4-1 et seq.). If there is anything about this form that you do not understand, you should ask a
lawyer to explain it to you.

Please place your initials on the following line indicating that you have read this Notice:

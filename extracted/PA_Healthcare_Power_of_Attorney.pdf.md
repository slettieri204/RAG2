14, 1958, being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily appoint the following individual as my Health

## PART II: AUTHORITY GRANTED

I grant my Health Care Agent full authority to make any and all health care decisions on my behalf,
including but not limited to the following:

diagnostic test, or therapeutic intervention, including experimental treatments;

(b) To authorize my admission to or discharge from any hospital, nursing home, assisted living
facility, rehabilitation center, hospice, or other medical facility;

(c) To access, obtain copies of, and authorize the release of my medical records and personal
health information, including information protected under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA);

(d) To retain and dismiss health care providers, physicians, nurses, therapists, and other

(f) To make decisions regarding organ donation and the disposition of my remains after death,
in accordance with my wishes expressed herein or previously communicated.


## PART III: INSTRUCTIONS AND WISHES

I provide the following guidance to my Health Care Agent regarding my preferences for medical
treatment:

End-of-Life Care: If I have a terminal condition with no reasonable expectation of recovery, or
if I am in a persistent vegetative state, I do NOT wish to be kept alive by artificial means,
including mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, or cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. I request that all comfort measures be provided to keep me pain-free and
comfortable.

Pain Management: I wish to receive adequate pain medication to maintain my comfort, even if
such medication may cloud my consciousness or hasten my death.

Organ Donation: Upon my death, I wish to donate any usable organs and tissues for the
purpose of transplantation and medical research.

Religious Considerations: I am of the Roman Catholic faith. While I respect the teachings of
my Church, my Health Care Agent should prioritize the medical guidance provided above,
which reflects my personal wishes after careful consideration.


## PART IV: EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURABILITY

This Health Care Power of Attorney shall become effective upon a determination by my attending
physician that I am unable to make or communicate health care decisions for myself. This power is
durable and shall not be affected by my subsequent disability or incapacity. This document shall remain
